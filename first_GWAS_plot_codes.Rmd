This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r Create a Manhattan Plot with colors}
rm(list=ls())
library(qqman)
library(tidyr)
y <- read.csv("~/R/R-Projects/GWAS_Test/AC3_dipper_b_logistic.assoc.logistic", sep="")
y <- drop_na(y)
manhattan(y, chr="CHR", bp="BP", snp="SNP", p="P", ylim = c(0, 10),
          col = c("cornflowerblue", "darkgoldenrod1"),
          genomewideline=-log10(5e-08),
          suggestiveline=-log10(1e-05), annotatePval = 0.00005, 
          annotateTop = FALSE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
